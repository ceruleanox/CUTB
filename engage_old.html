                    <p>There is almost nothing better than the bliss of a walk along the beach, 
                        feeling the salty breath of the sea breeze on your face, the sunshine 
                        warming your back and the soft sand filtering between your toes. But, 
                        there is also almost nothing worse than witnessing the beauty of the beach spoiled 
                        by human waste – especially plastic pollution! The beach is a place of relaxation.</p>

                    <h3 class="topic-header">Why Beach Clean-ups?</h3>
                    
                    <p>One of the major benefits of organizing a beach clean-up is that it brings people 
                        face-to-face with the reality of plastic pollution. While this is a hot topic 
                        at the moment, many people are unlikely to change their behavior until they understand
                        the scope of the plastic pollution and see the impact it has on the environment. 
                        To many people, plastic (especially single-use plastic) is an out of sight, out of mind 
                        type of problem, once it is in the bin – it is not their problem anymore. But all that 
                        waste has to go somewhere (since it doesn’t biodegrade) and it often ends up in the ocean
                        and, subsequently, ends up washing up on shore.</p>
                    
                        <p>By organizing a beach clean-up, volunteers are able to physically see the quantity of 
                        plastic littering the beach and have a greater understanding of the effort required to 
                        remove plastic from the marine system – having had to pick up the trash themselves. 
                        Seeing this problem first-hand is likely to encourage volunteers to assess plastic 
                        usage in their own community, and therefore consider modifying their own behavior. 
                        By being aware of the problem, volunteers can then raise awareness of plastic pollution
                        by discussing the issue among friends, family, schoolmates and colleagues, and encouraging 
                        them to modify their behavior as well.</p>
